# 23-24 ICT GROUP PROJECT
## Topic: Vietnamese License Plate Recognition System for parking lot monitoring
## Official branding name: ViePlateReg

## üìù Description
This is a project for the ICT course at USTH. The project is about a system that can recognize Vietnamese license plates and store the information of the vehicle in a database. The system will be used in parking lots to monitor the vehicles that enter and exit the parking lot. The system will also be able to detect the number of vehicles in the parking lot at any given time.

## üìù Project Status
We started this project from December 2023 along with ML2 and not yet finished (more information can be found in the commit history). The project was initially planned to be finished in 4 weeks with basic GUI and functions. We're in the development stage, so lots of bugs will exist.

The commit history will not showing the real contribution of each member. We had a lot of discussions at the library to decide what to do for each project's progress. 
In order for the members not to create many structurally different pieces of code, we decided to focus on a single machine during almost all development stages.
